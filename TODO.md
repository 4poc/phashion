TODO
=======

- Convert from RubyInline to a standard extconf.rb extension.
- Add video and audio APIs (someone else will have to do this, I have no need for it).
- Add broader support for the entire pHash API, include other types of hashes.  Currently
  the image support hardcodes use of the DCT hash.
- Add tunable dupe threshold so users can tune as necessary for their datasets.
